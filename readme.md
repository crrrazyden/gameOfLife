### Conway's Game of Life is a game invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The rules are as follows:

Each cell lives in a square in a rectangular grid. A cell can either be dead or alive (alive cells are coloured blue in our demo). Before you start the game, you need to provide an initial state. You can do this in the above example by clicking on squares, or by picking a preset from the dropdown menu.
